When making changes to tables (or creating new tables), edit the schema.prisma file.
Then, run the `npx prisma migrate dev --name [name_of_operation (ie add_login_history)]`
If manual changes have been made to the Schema (non-migration), run `npx prisma generate`

Might have to restart TS server for the changes to take effect in VS code (ie. autocomplete new table names)

To add data to the reference configuration tables (this is data that has to be in the table when it's first built (ie. lessons, questions, answers)):
	Edit the csv fils in `db-seed-data` folder, and
	Run: `npx prisma db seed`
	To seed in cloud, run `npm run cloud-seed`
