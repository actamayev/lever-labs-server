We've currently implemented unit tests on the cpp-parser.
Testing is extremely important for maintaining consistency across versions - to make sure that a minor parser change doesn't cause unexpected changes elsewhere
When changing parser code, get into the habit of running `npm run test`
IMPORTANT:
	Just because all of the tests pass, doesn't mean you're in the clear!
	The tests have to pass, and more importantly: ALL OF THEM HAVE TO RUN CORRECTLY ON PIP.
	Do not get lazy - copy the user code in the *.test.ts file into Postman, and run the test code. Make sure it runs as expected.
To visualize test coverage, run:
	`npm run test:coverage`
	`open coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
	Coverage should be 100%
