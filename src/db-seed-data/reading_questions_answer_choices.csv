                                1 ,                  1 ,"A parking lot full of cars"                                                ,true       ,"Correct. The N-layer has an abundance of free electrons, like a parking lot full of cars. The dopant atoms provide extra electrons that can move through the material."
                                2 ,                  1 ,"An empty parking lot"                                                      ,false      ,"Incorrect. An empty parking lot would represent a P-layer, which has a shortage of electrons. The N-layer has an abundance of electrons, not a shortage."
                                3 ,                  1 ,"A traffic light"                                                           ,false      ,"Incorrect. While a traffic light controls flow, the N-layer is characterized by having extra electrons, not by controlling their movement. It's more like a storage area for excess electrons."
                                4 ,                  1 ,"A solar panel"                                                             ,false      ,"Incorrect. A solar panel converts light to electrical energy, unlike the N-layer's function. The N-layer is a region with extra electrons, similar to a parking lot with many available cars."
                                5 ,                  2 ,"Electrons move randomly between layers with no energy release"             ,false      ,"Incorrect. Electron movement in an LED is directional (N-layer to P-layer) and releases energy in the form of light."
                                6 ,                  2 ,"Electrons fall from the N-layer to the P-layer, releasing energy as light" ,true       ,"Correct. Electrons move from the N-layer to the P-layer, and when they recombine with holes, they release energy as photons of light."
                                7 ,                  2 ,"Holes move up from the P-layer to the N-layer"                             ,false      ,"Incorrect. Holes stay in the P-layer while electrons move from the N-layer to fill them, not the other way around."
                                8 ,                  2 ,"Electrons and holes repel each other, creating heat"                       ,false      ,"Incorrect. Electrons and holes attract rather than repel, and their recombination produces light, not primarily heat."
                                9 ,                  3 ,"The water at the bottom of the cliff"                                      ,false      ,"Incorrect. The water at the bottom represents electrons that have already moved to the P-layer, not the voltage that drives them."
                               10 ,                  3 ,"The height of the cliff"                                                   ,false      ,"Incorrect. The cliff height represents the energy gap between layers, not the voltage applied to move electrons."
                               11 ,                  3 ,"The force pushing water over the edge"                                     ,true       ,"Correct. Voltage acts as the force that pushes electrons from the N-layer to the P-layer, just like a force pushing water over the cliff."
                               12 ,                  3 ,"The speed of the falling water"                                            ,false      ,"Incorrect. The water's speed is a result of the force applied, not the force itself, just as electron flow is a result of voltage."
                               13 ,                  4 ,"(0, 0, 255)"                                                               ,true       ,"Correct. In RGB color coding, blue uses 0 for red, 0 for green, and 255 for blue, creating pure blue light."

While LEDs do work with direct current, this isn't their fundamental distinguishing feature. Many LED systems can work with alternating current using adapters."

LEDs use semiconductor materials to directly convert electrical energy into light through a process called electroluminescence. This direct conversion is fundamentally different from both incandescent bulbs (which heat a filament) and fluorescent lights (which use UV light and phosphor coatings)."

Heating gases to produce light is characteristic of technologies like neon lights or plasma displays, not LEDs. LEDs use solid semiconductor materials, not gases."

Strobed monochromatic (single-color) lighting helps manufacturing robots capture clear images without motion blur.

While UV LEDs are useful for specific inspection tasks like detecting certain materials or contaminants, they aren't the most versatile option for general precision manufacturing."

Strobed lighting flashes precisely when cameras take images, freezing motion and creating clearer pictures without blur. This is essential for accurate inspection of moving parts."

While robots can use light for communication, strobed lighting in manufacturing is primarily used for enhancing machine vision, not for robot-to-robot communication."
