                                1 ,                  1 ,"A parking lot full of cars" ,true       ,"Correct. The N-layer has an abundance of free electrons, like a parking lot full of cars. The dopant atoms provide extra electrons that can move through the material."
                                2 ,                  1 ,"An empty parking lot"       ,false      ,"Incorrect. An empty parking lot would represent a P-layer, which has a shortage of electrons. The N-layer has an abundance of electrons, not a shortage."
                                3 ,                  1 ,"A traffic light"            ,false      ,"Incorrect. While a traffic light controls flow, the N-layer is characterized by having extra electrons, not by controlling their movement. It's more like a storage area for excess electrons."
                                4 ,                  1 ,"A solar panel"              ,false      ,"Incorrect. A solar panel converts light to electrical energy, unlike the N-layer's function. The N-layer is a region with extra electrons, similar to a parking lot with many available cars."
